# Learning_Engine
The Learning Engine is a "virtual machine" that can aid anyone studying any subject by providing custom, or user-based flash cards. 
It tracks each user's performance in order to show areas of strength as well as areas that need improvement. It will also compile a list
of the top "problem questions" for a given subject. This will be represented by a graph so students can see the areas that cause the most
issues for test-takers.
